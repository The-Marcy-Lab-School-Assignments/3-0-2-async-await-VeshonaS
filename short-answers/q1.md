# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
With `.then` you have to use a chaining method on multiple lines to retrieve data whereas, with `await` no chaining is necessary, and data can be retrieved in just a few lines, it also prevents callback hell.
